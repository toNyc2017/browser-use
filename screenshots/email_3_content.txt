Hi Lynn, 
My thoughts are in RED below.  I am copying Sarah as I think you intended to include her in the original email. 
If others think my positions are not aligned with any prior conversations internally or with AE, please let me know. 
Thanks

State Availability & Rules Clarifications
Hi Joe and Sarah, 
At present, we do NOT have any rules besides the Cross Border Restriction rules to govern the owner from residing or signing in any state – but we can add them if needed.
I’m clarifying our requirements regarding states in general and our e-App rules – I could use your help (and/or we can ask for Laura’s / Milliman’s opinion if needed).
The Application Jurisdiction (aka Issue State) will be limited to the states in which both Ceres Life is approved to do business and the MYGA is approved for sale by Ceres Life.
