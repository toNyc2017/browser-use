Hi Carrie,
Thank you.
Since Skadden has been working on the documentation up to now, I would have them take a peek at this change order.
Best,
Deanna

RE: Change order to agreement between Yorkville Data Technologies and Salem Holdings Group
Tom and Deanna,
Now that the Yorkville / CC Capital / SGH documents have been completed for work up until January 31, I believe it is time to revisit the extension of the SOW to June 30, 2025. Please find attached, which reflects the novation of the original contracts to SGH.
Deanna, do you want SRD legal or Skadden to take a look to see if any other language is needed for this documentation?
Carrie

Re: FAST - CereLifes Office Hours
I listened to the recording re: e-Delivery. I recommend that:
* We make the policy/party decision THEN look at the form and ensure it reflects our decision.
* One version of the e-Delivery form I’ve seen says that the current election belongs to the producer or the agent. I would like to see similar language in our model.
Glad that our conversation included notes on proper font size and color contrast - let’s ensure those are applied to the prototype.

Hi All,

I wanted to propose we align on the e-Delivery update during our next Office Hours. Mark your calendars for February 7th at 9 AM.

Thanks,
Tom
