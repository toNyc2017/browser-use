I was capturing follow ups during our call – they follow:
Product Questions:
What is the premium bonus percentage? We believe it is 7% (not 8%).
Premium bonus recapture
Are we recapturing only the premium bonus (or premium bonus plus interest on the bonus) using the schedule that is published?
What is the formula to calculate the amount of a premium bonus that is removed upon withdrawal?
Need more detail on the recapture process (calculations, what needs to be displayed to the client, accounting requirements, etc.).
We need to ensure the Contract expresses the recapture clearly.
Commission rates are high (10+%) – they seem higher than what Andrei sees in ANW.
Is the Product Development Fee paid 1x or is it recurring?
Confirm & document that it’s paid outside of FAST (through accounting) like the MYGA.
Page 9 “Other Features” Payout Doubler
Does this “doubler” pertain only to annuitizations, or to withdrawals and surrenders, or all three?
Confirm if this is a surrender charge waiver, or something else.
Any unique reporting or accounting needs?
Are we planning to launch with the GWLB rider?
If so, what is the Fair Market Value calculation for the GWLB (i.e. actuarial present value of the rider)?
We’ll use that to determine if FAST will calculate the FMV on these policies, or if we’ll calculate it outside of FAST.
